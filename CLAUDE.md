# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementing Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with dual-module architecture:

- **H-Module** (`reasoning_engine.py:HModule`): Strategic planning, problem decomposition, high-level decisions
- **L-Module** (`reasoning_engine.py:LModule`): Tactical execution, local optimizations, iterative refinement
- **State Management** (`state_manager.py`): SQLite-based persistence with session lifecycle management
- **Convergence Detection** (`convergence.py`): Local and global convergence monitoring

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start MCP server
uv run python -m src.hrm_mcp_server

# Type checking (REQUIRED after every edit)
uv run mypy src/

# Run meaningful tests (expect failures that reveal real issues)
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## How to Test This MCP Server

**The tests in this repository are designed to FIND BUGS, not just pass.**

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests - failures indicate real correctness issues
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/test_properties.py -v    # Mathematical properties
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py -v   # End-to-end workflows  
uv run pytest tests/test_reasoning.py -v     # Business logic
```

### Test Failures Are Expected
When tests fail, they reveal actual problems:
- **Convergence tests**: Verify reasoning actually converges on solvable problems
- **Property tests**: Check mathematical invariants hold (iteration bounds, confidence ranges)
- **Integration tests**: Ensure MCP tools work end-to-end with realistic tasks
- **Business logic tests**: Verify the system handles impossible/contradictory inputs appropriately

### Using the MCP with Claude Code
```bash
# Add this server to Claude Code MCP configuration
# Server should expose 4 tools: hierarchical_reason, decompose_task, refine_solution, analyze_reasoning_trace
```

## Core Principles

**EDIT FIRST, CREATE NEVER**: Always prefer editing existing files. Only create new files when absolutely necessary.

**MINIMAL DIFFS**: Achieve solutions with the fewest possible changes. Every edit must be essential.

**EVERY LINE MATTERS**: No redundant code. Every line must be crucial and needed.

## Python Standards

### Package Management
- Use `uv` for all Python package management
- Commands: `uv add`, `uv remove`, `uv sync`, `uv run`

### Type System
```python
# REQUIRED: Strict typing for all functions, variables, and return types
def process_data(items: list[dict[str, Any]]) -> dict[str, int]:
    result: dict[str, int] = {}
    return result
```

### Code Structure
- **Functions**: Max 10 lines, single responsibility
- **Modules**: Separate concerns strictly
- **Classes**: Only when state management is essential
- **Imports**: Grouped (standard, third-party, local) with minimal imports

## Quality Gates

### Mandatory After Every Edit
```bash
# Run type checker
uv run mypy .
# Or if using pyright
uv run pyright .
```

### Security First
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Input validation on all external data
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Production-ready code only (no mocks/simulations)

## MCP Tools Architecture

The server exposes 4 main MCP tools in `tools.py`:

- `hierarchical_reason`: Primary reasoning tool using dual H/L-module approach
- `decompose_task`: Break complex tasks into hierarchical subtasks
- `refine_solution`: Iteratively improve existing solutions with specific goals
- `analyze_reasoning_trace`: Post-hoc analysis of reasoning patterns and performance

## Key Configuration Files

- `config.yaml`: Runtime parameters for H/L-modules, convergence thresholds, persistence settings
- `pyproject.toml`: Dependencies, mypy strict typing configuration, pytest settings

## Testing Philosophy

**TESTS MUST VERIFY CORRECTNESS, NOT JUST PASS**

### What Makes a Good Test
- **Property-based**: Test mathematical/logical properties that must hold
- **Behavioral**: Verify actual business logic and edge cases
- **Integration**: Test full workflows, not just isolated units
- **Realistic**: Use real data and scenarios, not mocked happy paths

### Required Test Categories
1. **Property Tests**: Convergence behavior, session lifecycle invariants
2. **Integration Tests**: Full MCP tool workflows with realistic reasoning tasks
3. **Edge Case Tests**: Error conditions, malformed inputs, resource limits
4. **Performance Tests**: Convergence speed, memory usage under load

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Tests that only verify API contracts exist
- Mocked tests that don't exercise real logic
- Tests written just to increase coverage percentage
- Tests that pass regardless of implementation correctness

## Development Workflow

1. **Search First**: Use Qdrant MCP to understand codebase before changes
2. **Edit Minimally**: Find existing code to modify rather than create
3. **Type Check**: Run `uv run mypy src/` after every file modification
4. **Test Meaningfully**: Write tests that verify correctness, not just completion

## Session Management Patterns

- Sessions are created via `HRMServer.create_session()` with UUID tracking
- State persistence through `StateManager` with SQLite backend
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions (configurable retention period)
- Session status lifecycle: `ACTIVE` â†’ `COMPLETED`/`TIMEOUT`/`ERROR`

## Naming Conventions
- Variables: `snake_case` (concise but descriptive)
- Functions: `snake_case` (verb-based)
- Classes: `PascalCase` (noun-based)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## Error Handling
```python
# Concise, informative, secure
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {type(e).__name__}")
    raise ProcessingError("Unable to process request") from e
```

## File Organization
- Flat structure when possible
- Group related functionality in modules
- No deep nesting (max 3 levels)

**REMEMBER**: Code quality over quantity. Less code that works perfectly is better than more code that works adequately.
